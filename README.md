Use mailchimp API to add user email to my mailchimp user list

This project was my first node.js and express.js activity, where I connected mailchimp API to bootstrap signup form to gather user data for mailchim user list
I've diployed the app on Heroku https://obscure-journey-93610.herokuapp.com/signup
